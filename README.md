# Drum-KitThis project presents an interactive web-based drum kit simulation. The primary objective is to provide users with an intuitive platform where they can produce drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The interface includes a visual representation of different drum components, such as snare drums, cymbals, and bass drums, which are mapped to keys like 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'J', 'K', and 'L'. When a key is pressed, both the associated drum sound is played and the corresponding drum icon is visually activated, creating a responsive and engaging user experience.

The drum kit simulation is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing how web technologies can be utilized to create interactive audio applications. This project demonstrates the potential of web interfaces for musical education, entertainment, and practice, providing an accessible way for users to explore drumming without needing physical instruments. The application is designed with user experience in mind, ensuring it is simple to use, visually appealing, and highly responsive.
